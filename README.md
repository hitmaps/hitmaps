# HITMAN Maps
HITMAN Maps is an interactive site for viewing maps for HITMAN (2016) and hopefully HITMAN 2 (2018). This is essentially a copy of hitmanmaps.com, but with added maps for Professional Mode, the bonus mission "Landslide", and the entire Patient Zero campaign (with the exception of "The Vector").
