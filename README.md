# HITMAN Maps
HITMAN Maps is an interactive site for viewing maps for HITMAN (2016) and hopefully HITMAN 2 (2018). This is essentially a copy of hitmanmaps.com, but with added maps for Professional Mode, the bonus mission "Landslide", and the entire Patient Zero campaign (with the exception of "The Vector").

# Getting Started
1. Fork the repo to your own GitLab account
2. In the Config folder, make the following changes:
    1. Copy Settings.php.example to Settings.php (don't rename it as this example file should stay in source control). Then fill out the following properties:
        1. `databaseHost`: Your MySQL server's host location
        2. `databaseUser`: Your MySQL server database user
        3. `databasePassword`: The password to your MySQL database
        4. `databaseName`: The name to your MySQL database
        5. `accessKey`: A random string
        6. `loggingEnvironment`: Keep this 'development'
        7. `loggingAccessToken`: If you want to use Rollbar integration for logging,
        put your Rollbar token here.
        8. `superSecretPublicCode`: The registration code to register an account
        9. `cdnLocation`: Leave this as `/cdn`
        10. `recaptchaSiteKey`: Use '6LeIxAcTAAAAAJcZVRqyHh71UMIEGNQ_MXjiZKhI'
        11. `recaptchaSiteSecret`: Use '6LeIxAcTAAAAAGG-vFI1TnRWxMZNFuojJ4WifJWe'
        12. `emailMethod`: Use either 'SMTP' or 'MAILGUN'
        13. `smtp[Domain|Username|Password]`: SMTP server information if using SMTP
        14. `noReplyEmail`: The "from" address when sending out emails
        15. `bccEmail`: An email address if you want a copy of all emails sent out copied to 1 address
        16. `mailgun[ApiKey|Domain]`: Mailgun API information if using Mailgun
    2. If you want to have push notification support, you will have to create a
     Firebase account and project, and then export the `firebase-service-account.json` file to this folder
3. Copy `phinx.yml.example` to `phinx.yml` and update the `database` section with your MySQL database's information
4. Run `composer install` in the root folder to install all necessary `composer` dependencies
5. Run `vendor\bin\phinx migrate -e development` in the root folder to run all necessary database migrations
6. Run `php -S localhost:8000` to run the local PHP development server and get started with development ðŸ™‚
