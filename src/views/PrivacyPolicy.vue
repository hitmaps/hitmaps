                This legal stuff is really a big pain and we would rather focus on
                delivering new features to this site. Please be respectful and
                patient and contact us directly if you have any concerns regarding
                the privacy policy. We'd rather not have to worry about this legal

            <p>HITMAPS operates several websites including <a href="https://www.hitmaps.com">hitmaps.com</a>,
                <a href="https://roulette.hitmaps.com">roulette.hitmaps.com</a>, and
                <a href="https://tournaments.hitmaps.com">tournaments.hitmaps.com</a>. It is HITMAPS' policy to respect
                your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
            </p>
            <h2>What This Policy Covers</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use our websites.</p>
            <p>Throughout this Privacy Policy, we‚Äôll refer to our websites collectively as ‚ÄúServices.‚Äù</p>
            <p>Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so‚Äìfor example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>
            <p>We collect information in two ways: if and when you provide information to us and automatically through operating our Services. Let‚Äôs go over the information that we collect.</p>
            <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
            <p>It‚Äôs probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>(hitmaps.com) Basic Account Information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in
                    order to set up your account. For example, when you log in via Discord, we will collect and store
                    your unique Discord ID and email address, so we can properly identify you in the future.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>(tournaments.hitmaps.com) Basic Account Information:</strong> We ask for basic information from
                    you if you choose to register for an upcoming tournament. This information may include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Name</li>
                        <li>Unique Discord Identifier</li>
                        <li>Country of Residence</li>
                        <li>Twitch <i>or</i> YouTube Channel Name</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
            <p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Log Information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that
                    web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP
                    address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of
                    access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use
                    our Services‚Äìfor example, when you create or make changes to items on maps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services. For
                    example, we collect information about the pages you visit or site parts that you check the most. We
                    use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how
                    people use our Services, so we can make our Services better. We use Google Analytics to aggregate
                    this information, and we are not able to personally identify you with this information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Location Information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from
                    your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people
                    visit our Services from certain geographic regions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Information from Cookies &amp; Other Technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of
                    information that a website stores on a visitor‚Äôs computer, and that the visitor‚Äôs browser provides
                    to the website each time the visitor returns. HITMAPS uses cookies to help us identify and track
                    visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                And, we will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out
                in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                accounting or other legal requirements).
            </p>
            <h2>How And Why We Use Information</h2>
            <h3>Purposes for Using Information</h3>
            <p>We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide our Services‚Äìfor example, to set up and maintain your account;</li>
                <li>
                    To further develop and improve our Services‚Äìfor example by adding new features that we think our
                    users will enjoy;
                </li>
                <li>
                    To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which
                    helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;
                </li>
                <li>
                    To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect
                    and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights
                    and property of HITMAPS and others, which may result in us declining a transaction or the use of our
                    Services; and
                </li>
                <li>To personalize your experience using our Services.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</h3>
            <p>
                A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you
                under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:
            </p>
            <p>
                (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under our Terms of Service or other
                agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account‚Äìfor example, in order to enable access to
                our website on your device; or
            </p>
            <p>(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or</p>
            <p>(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or</p>
            <p>
                (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information‚Äìfor example, to provide and update our
                Services, to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience, to safeguard
                our Services, to communicate with you, to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, and to
                personalize your experience; or
            </p>
            <p>(5) You have given us your consent‚Äìfor example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on.</p>
            <h2>Sharing Information</h2>
            <h3>How We Share Information</h3>
            <p>We do not sell our users‚Äô private personal information.</p>
            <p>
                We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate
                safeguards on your privacy:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Legal Requests:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena,
                    court order, or other governmental request.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when
                    we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
                    of HITMAPS, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that
                    there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related
                    to the emergency without delay.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or
                    acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, user information would likely be
                    one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to
                    happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your
                    information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at
                    your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you
                    authorize us to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to our site.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against
                unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as
                monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
            </p>
            <h2>Choices</h2>
            <p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:</strong> At this time, it is not known whether or not
                    HITMAPS responds to "do not track" signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually
                    choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using HITMAPS' websites, with
                    the drawback that certain features of HITMAPS' websites may not function properly without the aid of
                    cookies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Request Account Deletion:</strong> While we‚Äôd be very sad to see you go, if you no longer
                    want to use our Services :( :( :( :(, you can request to have your hitmaps.com information deleted.
                    Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after this request, as described
                    in Information We Collect above‚Äìfor example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply
                    with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or
                    reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>
                If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European
                General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the ‚ÄúGDPR‚Äù), data protection laws give you rights with respect
                to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
                <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
                <li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
                <li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
                <li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that
                we offer, but if you aren‚Äôt able to do that, or you would like to contact us about one of the other
                rights, scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, find out how to reach us.

            <h2>Other Things You Should Know</h2>
            <h3>Transferring Information</h3>
            <p>
                Because HITMAPS‚Äô Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when you use
                the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the
                European Economic Area (EEA). This is required for the purposes listed in the How and Why We Use
                Information section above. When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will
                take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in
                accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law.
            </p>
            <h3>Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others</h3>
            <p>
                Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These analytics providers may set
                tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across
                other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your
                device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and
                other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage. Please note this Privacy Policy only
                covers the collection of information by HITMAPS and does not cover the collection of information by any
                third party advertisers or analytics providers.
            </p>
            <h3>List of Sub-processors</h3>
            <p>HITMAPS uses the following products/services (which are all GDPR compliant):</p>

                <li><strong>Digital Ocean:</strong> for storing data.</li>
